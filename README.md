## üìã Dashboard Creation

AI Agent HA now supports creating and managing Home Assistant dashboards through natural language conversations! Simply describe what you want, and the AI will create a complete dashboard for you.

### How Dashboard Creation Works

1. **Natural Language Request**: Ask the AI to create a dashboard for any purpose
2. **Entity Discovery**: The AI automatically finds relevant entities in your Home Assistant
3. **Smart Organization**: Entities are organized by room, functionality, or domain
4. **Dashboard Generation**: Complete dashboard with proper cards and layout is created
5. **Integration**: Dashboard is automatically added to your Home Assistant sidebar
6. **Restart Required**: You'll need to restart Home Assistant to see the new dashboard in your sidebar

### Dashboard Creation Examples

#### Simple Room Dashboard
```
"Create a dashboard for my living room lights"
```
The AI will find all living room light entities and create a dashboard with appropriate light control cards.

#### Security Dashboard
```
"Create a security dashboard with all door sensors, cameras, and alarm controls"
```
The AI will create a comprehensive security monitoring dashboard with sensor states, camera feeds, and alarm controls. After creation, restart Home Assistant to see the new dashboard in your sidebar.

#### Energy Monitoring Dashboard
```
"I want an energy dashboard showing power consumption and usage graphs"
```
The AI will create an energy monitoring dashboard with real-time power gauges, usage graphs, and cost tracking.

#### Climate Control Dashboard
```
"Create a climate dashboard for temperature control throughout the house"
```
The AI will organize thermostats, temperature sensors, and HVAC controls in a logical layout.

### Supported Dashboard Features

- **Smart Card Selection**: Appropriate card types for each entity (lights, sensors, media players, etc.)
- **Room-Based Organization**: Entities automatically grouped by area when possible
- **Interactive Clarification**: AI asks follow-up questions to refine your requirements
- **Template-Based Creation**: Built-in templates for common dashboard types (security, energy, climate, etc.)
- **Dynamic Layout**: Optimized card arrangements and view organization
- **Icon Integration**: Automatic Material Design icon selection

### Dashboard Types the AI Can Create

- **Room-Specific**: Living room, bedroom, kitchen, etc.
- **Functional**: Security, energy, climate, media, lighting
- **Device-Specific**: All lights, all sensors, all switches
- **Scenario-Based**: Morning routine, evening security, vacation mode
- **Custom**: Any combination based on your specific needs
